I like the variety of courses, for example, math, physics, organic chemistry, laboratory practices. Also, one nice thing is having a lot of free time for other activities like theater plays or concerts. In the afternoons, I like going to the gym, it is good and I don’t have to pay for it. I hope I can enjoy the next five years of my life."

Anatomy was complicated because there was a lot of different parts to learn. Molecular biology was hard too, but it was very interesting. I really liked attending to conferences and academic events. I think the best experience I had in college was my clinical practicum. I learned a lot with real patients."
